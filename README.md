# Spring Boot Playground

This repository has several projects showcasing different Spring Boot features:

* data-jdbc - using Spring Data JDBC for working with databases
* data-jpa - using Spring Data JPA for working with databases
* test-slices - using Spring Boot Test slices
* value-deser - deserializing immutable values
* vanilla-webflux - a Spring WebFlux application with zero Spring magic

Each directory is its own standalone Gradle project. All projects require Java 11 or higher, 
unless otherwise noted.
