# Spring Boot Playground

This repository has several projects showcasing different Spring Boot features.

Each directory is its own standalone Gradle project. All projects require Java 11 or higher, unless otherwise noted:

* data-jdbc - using Spring Data JDBC for working with databases
* data-jpa - using Spring Data JPA for working with databases
* test-slices - using Spring Boot Test slices
* value-deser - using Jackson to deserialize immutable values
* vanilla-webflux - a Spring WebFlux application with zero Spring magic
* validation - using Spring Boot Validation and the differences between @Valid and @Validation
